      			<h2>About the Chef</h2>
				<p>I have been working on my vision of "Healthy Eating on the Run" a gourmet food truck.</p>
				<p>I believe that the time is now to present healthy food options to Genesee and surrounding counties. Urban gardening and alternative eating styles are not only desired but also much needed. We are facing a population that is more obese and ill than ever before. My true belief is that much of the problems stem from the food we consume. Through change in individuals including; my wife, son and several friends and family members.</p>
				<p>I am a pastry chef by trade. I am also a traditional chef. My wife decided to remove gluten from her diet several years ago. To assist her in her dietary need I educated myself about cooking gluten free. This became the new avenue for my catering business. While I still cater for individuals and provide traditional meals, I have found once individuals are educated about gluten free and other healthy eating styles and they taste my food, they are inclined to choose the healthy options. I believe that quality and taste should never be secondary.</p>
